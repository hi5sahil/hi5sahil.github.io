Just one of the times you stumble upon an excellent dataset on Kaggle for a really interesting data mining problem - sarcasm detection in text. I have looked for labelled datasets for this problem earlier but couldn't find a reasonably clean corpus with sufficient instances.

But this json has a class-balanced dataset with ~27K news headlines labelled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
